Short story:

	mkdir build
	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd)/build bsdmake
	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd)/build bsdmake DESTDIR=/usr/local install

WARNING:  Do not specify DESTDIR for the first (build) phase!

(where "bsdmake" is of course a 'make' of the BSD persuasion,
e.g. "make" on BSDs, "bsdmake" on older Darwin/OSX, or "bmake" on
other non-BSD-based systems.)

See also the comments in the top-level Makefile for more hints about
issues with various mk-files (also some more comments in Makefile.inc).

When things go wrong:

Acquire and install bmake and mk-files and try again.

        http://www.crufty.net/ftp/pub/sjg/mk.tar.gz

NOTES:

- some mk-files support a "regress" target which can be used to run
  all the tests from the top level of the source tree -- if yours
  doesn't you can go into the tests, example, and perf directories
  directly and run "make regress" in each

- bmake from http://pkgsrc.org/ is another good option, though it
  currently has some issues with shared libraries on platforms which
  cannot use GNU binutils, such as OSX/Darwin (but see Makefile for a
  work-around to avoid building a shared library -- you really don't
  need it anyway)

- if you have "cxref" installed you can build (and install) the
  documentation as well:

	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd)/build bsdmake docs
	MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=$(pwd)/build bsdmake DESTDIR=/usr/local install-docs
