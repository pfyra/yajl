Short story:

	bsdmake && bsdmake DESTDIR=/usr/local install

(where "bsdmake" is of course a 'make' of the BSD persuasion,
e.g. "make" on BSDs, "bsdmake" on Darwin/OSX, or "bmake" on other
non-BSD-based systems.)

When things go wrong:

Acquire and install bmake and mk-files and try again.

        http://www.crufty.net/ftp/pub/sjg/mk.tar.gz

NOTES:

- some mk-files support a "regress" target which can be used to run
  all the tests from the top level of the source tree -- if yours
  doesn't you can go into the tests, example, and perf directories
  directly and run "make regress" in each

- bmake from http://pkgsrc.org/ is another good option, though it
  currently has some issues with shared libraries on platforms which
  cannot use GNU binutils, such as OSX/Darwin (but see Makefile for a
  work-around to avoid building a shared library -- you really don't
  need it anyway)

- see the comments in the top-level Makefile for more hints about
  issues with various mk-files (also more in Makefile.inc)

- on NetBSD-5.x it may be necessary to run "make && make
  DESTDIR=... install && make && make DESTDIR=...", i.e. run "make"
  again after the install fails, then install again (something goes
  wrong with shared library install and it tries to make it again
  during install, probably a dependency seems out of date but really
  isn't, but with DESTDIR set, the build during install fails)
