Short story:

	mkdir /path/somwhere
	env MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=/path/somewhere bsdmake
	env MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=/path/somewhere bsdmake DESTDIR=/usr/local
        rm -rf /path/somewhere

(where "bsdmake" is of course a 'make' of the BSD persuasion,
e.g. "make" on BSDs, "bsdmake" on Darwin/OSX, or "bmake" on other
non-BSD-based systems.)

When things go wrong:

Acquire and install bmake and mk-files and try again.

NOTES:

- on NetBSD-5.x it may be necessary to run "make
  MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=... all" after trying an install, then run the
  install again (something goes wrong with shared library building)
